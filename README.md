# Medical Diagnosis Using ML

A Streamlit-based Machine Learning web application that predicts the likelihood of Heart Disease, Lung Cancer, Parkinson's Disease, and Thyroid Disorders using trained ML models and user inputs.

## Features

- Heart Disease Prediction  
- Lung Cancer Detection  
- Parkinson’s Disease Detection  
- Thyroid Disease Detection  
- Interactive Streamlit UI  
- Pre-trained models (.sav) for instant predictions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)  
- Streamlit for web interface  
- Pickle for model serialization  
- Jupyter Notebooks for model development

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/isha0605/Medical-Diagnosis-Using-ML.git
cd Medical-Diagnosis-Using-ML
```

### 2. Run the App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
## 📌 Future Work

- [ ] Deploy on Streamlit Cloud / Render  
- [ ] Add graphical visualizations  
- [ ] Support more diseases like Diabetes  
- [ ] Include model retraining feature
